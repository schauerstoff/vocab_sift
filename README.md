# vocab_sift
Compare lists of new words to your database and sift out all the duplicates!

Also get some stats and see how much you know already. 
There will be an option to manually go through the remaining vocab and add them to Anki in a yomichan-style (only japanese).
Using a controller is recommended. (Black background, audio should be played while deciding y/n to add to anki)

Idea 4 stats-> how many new kanji even
